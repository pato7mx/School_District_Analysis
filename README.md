# School_District_Analysis

## Overview of the school district analysis
For this analysis we took a look at the data from 15 schools from grades 9th to 12th. We analyzed grades in math and reading, number of studentes per school, school budget among other data points. After doing the analysis we were informed that the 9th grade scores for at Thomas High School have been tampered with. Because of this we were tasked to redo the analysis deleting that aftermentioned data.

## Results after removing THS 9th grader data


-The number of students decreases from the first to the second image because the second image doesn´t include the 9th graders from THS
- The % Passing Math, % Passing Reading and % Overall Passing went from overall 90% to 60%. The overall averages do not suffer any big change. The huge dip in passing % is due to removing the 9th grader data from THS, but we can clearly see that data point is not significant as it was affected by the "NAs"

From this analysis I would say that the 9th graders data from THS was not playing a significant role in the results, so I would suggest keeping the data or researching why the say that the data was incorrect


## Conclusion

From this data analysis we can get some key insights:
- Big budget doesn´t mean better results
- Schools with higher student count tend to have worse performance
- I would suggest that the 9th grader data from THS was not tampered with and should stay in the anlaysis
- Schools with less students tend to have better results, so I would suggest to keep student count low to imporve performace
